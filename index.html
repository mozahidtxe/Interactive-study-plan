    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as an interactive dashboard to transform the static study plan into an engaging, task-oriented tool. The structure features a top navigation to switch between the four weeks, preventing information overload from a long scroll. Each week's content is presented in an accordion format, allowing users to focus on one day at a time. The core interactive element is a progress tracker, visualized by a donut chart, which updates as users mark topics "complete." This structure was chosen for its superior usability, providing a clear, focused, and motivating user flow that encourages completion of the learning journey. Gemini API features are integrated directly into daily tasks to provide contextual learning aids without disrupting the primary flow. Progress is saved to localStorage for persistence. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Overall Progress -> Goal: Motivate -> Viz: Donut Chart -> Interaction: Updates on task completion -> Justification: Provides instant visual feedback on progress, enhancing user motivation. -> Library: Chart.js/Canvas.
        - Report Info: Weekly Structure -> Goal: Organize/Navigate -> Presentation: Tab-like Navigation -> Interaction: Click to show/hide weekly content sections -> Justification: Breaks down the 28-day plan into manageable, non-linear sections, improving navigation. -> Library/Method: HTML/JS.
        - Report Info: Daily Topics -> Goal: Organize/Focus -> Presentation: Accordion List -> Interaction: Click to expand/collapse daily details -> Justification: Manages information density and allows users to concentrate on a single learning objective. -> Library/Method: HTML/JS.
        - Report Info: Task Completion -> Goal: Track -> Presentation: Button/Checkbox -> Interaction: Toggles completion state -> Justification: The primary interaction that makes the plan a functional tool rather than a static document. -> Library/Method: HTML/JS.
        - Report Info: Complex Concepts -> Goal: Simplify -> Presentation: Button + Modal -> Interaction: Click to call Gemini API and display simplified explanation -> Justification: Provides on-demand clarification of difficult topics, enhancing comprehension. -> Library/Method: Gemini API.
        - Report Info: Abstract Tools -> Goal: Contextualize -> Presentation: Button + Modal -> Interaction: Click to call Gemini API and generate a localized case study -> Justification: Connects theoretical frameworks to practical, relatable examples. -> Library/Method: Gemini API.
        - Report Info: User Progress -> Goal: Persist -> Presentation: Buttons (Load/Clear) & Status Text -> Interaction: Auto-save on change, manual load/clear -> Justification: Allows users to save their progress across sessions using browser localStorage. -> Library/Method: HTML/JS (localStorage).
